# Portfolio-Website
This is a showcase website that serves as a personal developer portfolio, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.<br>It includes a homepage, a page presenting my skills, an « About » page featuring my resume, a contact page with a form, a project listing page with a filter allowing sorting by different categories (none, academic, or personal), a page with detailed information about each project, and a page that lets users play a game directly via a WebGL link when available.<br>The design is based on a general stylesheet, complemented by specific CSS files for each page. The website is bilingual, with the ability to switch between French and English, and includes a button to toggle between light and dark themes, which also affects the resume display. Two dedicated JavaScript files manage the language and theme features.<br>The site is designed to be easily maintainable: adding new content simply requires inserting a new entry into an array within the scripts/data.php script. I paid close attention to both functionality and visual presentation to achieve a professional and user-friendly result.
